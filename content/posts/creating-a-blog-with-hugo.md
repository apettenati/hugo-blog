I *finally* created a blog after nearly a decade of waffling. Now that it's done, I can't believe I waited so long. 

## Objectives

My objective was to set up a static site where I could write posts in markdown to easily deploy them. I wanted to hit the ground running as quickly as possible. I also needed good documentation considering this is my first experience setting up a site.

## Static Site Generator

Originally I created the blog with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) since it is written in Python which is my primary language. Ultimately, I found that there were multiple inconsistencies in the documentation and I couldn't find a theme that I liked and was well documented. I found it difficult to navigate this process for the first time with the resources available to me. Now that I have more experience, I may try this framework again at some point in the future.

I stumbled into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and quickly realized this would be a better choice for me. The documentation was more clear and to the point so I could be up and running quickly. I was also able to find themes that had better documentation around configuration. I found the [cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus/) theme which is *super* cute and exactly what I was looking for! Simple and to the point. I put my limited CSS skills to the test by making some small changes to colors and formatting. Hugo's built in web server comes with [LiveReload](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#livereload) pre-installed and enabled which was incredibly convenient. My blog was running in 30 minutes flat.

It's possible my stumbling around with Pelican led to me having a better understanding of what a general static site framework can offer, but the Hugo experience seemed more user friendly for new folk. I look forward to exploring the rest of their functionality soon. I made a commitment to myself that an actual blog post has to come before more tinkering with the site itself ;)

## Hosting

I recently purchased my domain from Google and decided to use Firebase to host my site. I don't see a need to pay for any services at this point, and this seems to be a popular free option. I found their [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/?authuser=0#implementation_path) to be mostly straightforward and Hugo had [convenient instructions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-firebase/) as well.

## Content

I'm expecting this will mostly be about my experience teaching myself how to program. Soon I'll post about my first week at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)! As I exercise my writing muscle and get more comfortable publishing my thoughts to the world, I'll start to post about other things that are important to me.

## Summary

I'm excited to see how this blog evolves as I learn more about web development and if my opinion on Hugo changes. Time to face the bigger obstacle: **writing**.
